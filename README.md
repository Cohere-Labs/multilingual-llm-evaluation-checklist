This repository contains a **multilingual evaluation checklist**, which may assist researchers in evaluating generative abilities of their multilingual LLMs. 
It can serve as a guideline when making decisions about which evaluations to report and how.

For context, it is recommended to read our paper [link tbd] on multilingual generative evaluation practices.
